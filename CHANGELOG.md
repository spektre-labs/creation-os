## v59 σ-Budget — σ-decomposed adaptive test-time compute budget controller (2026-04-16)

- **Driving oivallus.** Q2 2026 adaptive-reasoning-budget field (TAB
  arXiv:2604.05164, CoDE-Stop arXiv:2604.04930, LYNX arXiv:2512.05325,
  DTSR arXiv:2604.06787, DiffAdapt, Coda arXiv:2603.08659, AdaCtrl
  arXiv:2505.18822, Risk-Control Budget Forcing) converges on one open
  problem — **how much compute to spend on the next reasoning step** —
  and answers with a **scalar** signal (entropy, confidence dynamic,
  probe scalar, RL policy, reflection-tag counter). **Nobody** uses the
  v34 σ = (ε, α) decomposition, even though the rest of Creation OS
  already speaks that dialect (v55 σ₃, v56 σ-Constitutional, v57
  Verified Agent, v58 σ-Cache). **v59 closes that gap** at the
  test-time compute budget layer.
- **Policy.** Per-step readiness
  `r(t) = β·stability(t) + γ·reflection(t) − α_ε·ε(t) − δ·α(t)`,
  σ_total = ε + α, α_frac = α / (ε + α). Four-valued decision:
  **CONTINUE / EARLY_EXIT / EXPAND / ABSTAIN**. Priority cascade:
  at-cap > abstain > expand > exit-on-ready > continue. ABSTAIN fires
  only when σ is high **and** α dominates — the decision no
  scalar-signal method can produce faithfully.
- **Kernel (`src/v59/sigma_budget.c`).** Branchless hot path: 0/1 lane
  masks from integer compares combined with `& | ~` in an AND-NOT
  priority cascade; final tag is a four-way branchless mux. Scratch
  via `aligned_alloc(64, ⌈n · 20/64⌉·64)`. Prefetch 16 lanes ahead in
  every history-walking loop. Explicit NEON 4-accumulator SoA
  readiness reduction (`cos_v59_score_soa_neon`) materialises the
  `.cursorrules` item 5 pattern (four lanes, three `vfmaq_f32` stages)
  and is tested against a scalar reference within 1e-4.
- **Self-test (`creation_os_v59 --self-test`).** **69 / 69**
  deterministic assertions covering: version / defaults / null safety,
  score monotonicity (ε↓readiness, α↓readiness), stability reward,
  reflection lift, batch = scalar, NEON SoA = scalar, translation
  invariance in `step_idx`, all four decision tags reachable, cap
  beats abstain, abstain beats expand, abstain beats exit-on-ready,
  below-min forces continue, determinism, idempotency on stable
  appended history, summary counts sum to n, summary totals = Σ
  per-step, summary final = online decision, random stress invariants,
  aligned-alloc zeroing + 64-byte alignment, end-to-end scenarios
  (easy → EARLY_EXIT, ambiguous → ABSTAIN, hard-tractable → EXPAND,
  mixed input → multiple tags).
- **Microbench (`make microbench-v59`).** Three-point sweep N = 64 /
  512 / 4096. Measured on an M-class chip: **1.1 – 1.5 × 10⁸
  decisions / s** — at 100 M dec/s the budget controller is effectively
  free even at 10⁵-token reasoning traces.
- **Composition.** v59 registers as the `adaptive_compute_budget`
  slot in the v57 Verified Agent (`src/v57/verified_agent.c`).
  `make verify-agent` now reports **8 PASS, 3 SKIP, 0 FAIL** across
  eleven composition slots (previously 7 / 3 / 0).
- **Non-claims.** v59 does **not** claim better end-to-end
  tokens-per-correct than TAB / CoDE-Stop / LYNX / DTSR on GSM8K /
  MATH / AIME. End-to-end accuracy-under-budget is a **P** tier
  measurement; v59 ships **policy + kernel + correctness proof**
  (**M** tier, 69 deterministic self-tests), not a leaderboard row.
  σ is v34's signal; v59's novelty is its decomposition as the
  adaptive-compute-budget decision surface. No Frama-C proof yet.
- **Files.**
  - `src/v59/sigma_budget.h` — public API + tier semantics + non-claims.
  - `src/v59/sigma_budget.c` — scalar / NEON scoring + branchless
    decision + offline summary.

## v58 σ-Cache — σ-decomposed KV-cache eviction with a branchless NEON kernel (2026-04-16)

- **Driving oivallus.** Q2 2026 KV-cache eviction literature
  (StreamingLLM, H2O, SnapKV, PyramidKV, KIVI, KVQuant, SAGE-KV,
  G-KV, EntropyCache, Attention-Gate) uses **one scalar** signal
  per token: position, attention mass, quantisation residue, or
  entropy. **Nobody** uses a **decomposed** σ = (ε, α) signal —
  even though the rest of the Creation OS stack already speaks
  that dialect (v34 Dirichlet split, v55 σ₃ triangulation, v56
  σ-governed IP-TTT, v57 σ-tiered registry). **v58 closes that
  gap** at the KV-cache layer.
- **Policy.** Per-token retention score
  `s(t) = α_ε·ε(t) + β·attn(t) + γ·recency(t) − δ·α(t) + sink_lift(t)`,
  budgeted by `τ_keep = K-th largest non-sink score` where `K =
  max(capacity − sinks_present, 0)`. Four-valued decision: **FULL
  / INT8 / INT4 / EVICTED** by per-token precision thresholds
  `τ_full`, `τ_int8` layered under the budget — a token that
  clears `τ_int8` but misses `τ_keep` is still EVICTED.
- **Kernel (`src/v58/sigma_cache.c`).** Branchless hot path: 0/1
  lane masks from float compares combined with `| & ~`; a
  four-way branchless mux assembles the tag byte. Compaction
  writes every index unconditionally and advances by a 0/1 kept
  flag. Scratch via `aligned_alloc(64, ⌈n·4/64⌉·64)`. Prefetch 16
  lanes ahead. An explicit NEON 4-accumulator SoA score reduction
  (`cos_v58_score_soa_neon`) materialises the `.cursorrules`
  item 5 pattern (four lanes, three `vfmaq_f32` stages) and is
  tested against a scalar reference within 1e-4.
- **Self-test (`creation_os_v58 --self-test`).** **68 / 68**
  deterministic assertions covering: version / default-policy
  invariants, score monotonicity in each axis (ε↑, attn↑, α↓),
  branchless recency window equivalence, translation invariance,
  attention-scale order preservation, sink lift dominance, scalar
  ≡ batched equivalence, NEON-SoA ≡ scalar-SoA within tolerance,
  null safety across `decide` and `compact`, n=0 edge case, sinks
  always kept, `kept + evicted == n`, `kept_total ≤ capacity +
  sinks`, zero-capacity forces all-evict, monotone capacity,
  determinism under fixed policy + seed, threshold populated in
  summary, two 10-iteration random stress tests, and compaction
  equivalence.
- **Microbench (`make microbench-v58`).** 3-point sweep
  (N = 1024 / 4096 / 16384); deterministic across runs; prints
  ms/iter, decisions/s, kept histogram, and the selected threshold
  so reviewers can audit the policy externally.
- **Composition into the Verified Agent (v57).** v58 is
  registered as a new `kv_cache_eviction` slot in
  `src/v57/verified_agent.c` (owner: v58, tier: **M**, target:
  `make check-v58`). `make verify-agent` now reports **10** slots
  (7 PASS + 3 SKIP + 0 FAIL on a baseline host) and breaks
  aggregate status if `check-v58` fails.
- **Non-claims.** v58 ships the **policy + kernel + proof of
  correctness**. It does **not** claim lower perplexity than H2O
  / SnapKV / KIVI / EntropyCache on any standard benchmark — that
  requires end-to-end integration with a transformer runtime and
  belongs to a future **P-tier** measurement. Formal memory-safety
  proofs belong to the v47 slot, not v58. σ-decomposition
  novelty belongs to v34; v58 claims novelty for **σ applied as a
  KV-cache eviction policy**.
- **Files.** `src/v58/sigma_cache.{h,c}`,
  `src/v58/creation_os_v58.c`, `scripts/v58/microbench.sh`,
  `docs/v58/{THE_SIGMA_CACHE,ARCHITECTURE,POSITIONING,paper_draft}.md`.
- **Cross-doc.** `README.md` σ-lab table v31–v57 → v31–v58 with a
  new row; `docs/DOC_INDEX.md` adds the `docs/v58/` entries;
  `scripts/v57/verify_agent.sh` adds `kv_cache_eviction` to its
  `SLOTS` array; `Makefile` gets `standalone-v58`, `test-v58`,
  `check-v58`, `microbench-v58` targets; `.gitignore` adds
  `creation_os_v58` and `creation_os_v58_asan`.

## v57 The Verified Agent — convergence of v33–v56 (2026-04-16)

- **No new σ math.** v57 is the *convergence artifact* of the
  Creation OS family. Every piece of math it relies on shipped in
  v33–v56. v57's contribution is the explicit **invariant +
  composition registry** that names which Creation OS subsystem
  owns which agent-runtime surface, and tags every claim with one
  of four explicit tiers (M / F / I / P).
- **Driving oivallus.** The Q2 2026 open-source agent-framework
  field offers ad-hoc sandboxing — Docker containers, WASM
  sandboxes, capability allowlists — and rests on prompt-engineered
  reasoning loops. Every framework's user-facing claim reduces to
  *"trust our architecture"*. v57's user-facing claim is the
  opposite: *"run `make verify-agent`"*.
- **Tier semantics (no blending).**
  - **M** — runtime-checked deterministic self-test (`make` target
    returns 0 iff the check passes)
  - **F** — formally proven proof artifact (Frama-C / WP / sby /
    TLA+ / Coq)
  - **I** — interpreted / documented (no mechanical check yet)
  - **P** — planned (next concrete step explicit)
- **Invariant registry (`src/v57/invariants.{c,h}`).** Five
  invariants chosen to span the surface that ad-hoc agent
  frameworks typically *trust the architecture* on:
  `sigma_gated_actions`, `bounded_side_effects`,
  `no_unbounded_self_modification`, `deterministic_verifier_floor`,
  `ensemble_disagreement_abstains`. Each invariant carries up to
  four checks (runtime, formal, documented, planned) and a
  best-tier query.
- **Composition registry (`src/v57/verified_agent.{c,h}`).** Nine
  composition slots: `execution_sandbox` (v48, M),
  `sigma_kernel_surface` (v47, F), `harness_loop` (v53, M),
  `multi_llm_routing` (v54, M), `speculative_decode` (v55, M),
  `constitutional_self_modification` (v56, M),
  `do178c_assurance_pack` (v49, I), `red_team_suite` (v48 + v49,
  I), `convergence_self_test` (v57, M). Each slot has exactly one
  owning `make` target.
- **Driver (`src/v57/creation_os_v57.c`).** Modes: `--self-test`
  (49/49 deterministic registry tests — count, uniqueness, tier
  monotonicity, find-by-id, histogram sums, slot completeness),
  `--architecture` (composition + invariant table with tier tags),
  `--positioning` (vs ad-hoc agent sandboxes, with explicit
  non-claims), `--verify-status` (static tier histogram).
  No socket, no allocation on a hot path; registry is `static
  const`.
- **Live aggregate (`scripts/v57/verify_agent.sh`).** Walks the
  composition slots, dispatches each owning `make` target, reports
  per-slot **PASS / SKIP / FAIL**. **SKIP** is emitted when the
  target ran without error but matched `SKIP\b` in its output
  (existing Creation OS pattern when external tools — Frama-C, sby,
  garak, DeepTeam, pytest extras — are not installed). Never
  silently downgrades a slot. Flags: `--strict` (treat SKIP as
  FAIL for CI hosts with full tooling), `--json PATH` (machine-
  readable report), `--quiet` (final summary line only).
- **Makefile.** New targets: `standalone-v57`, `test-v57`,
  `check-v57`, **`verify-agent`** (live aggregate). All marked
  *not* merge-gate. v57 binary added to `.gitignore`.
- **Documentation (`docs/v57/`).**
  - `THE_VERIFIED_AGENT.md` — one-page articulation of the
    artifact, with explicit non-claims list (no FAA / EASA
    certification, no zero-CVE claim, no frontier-accuracy claim,
    no specific-product comparison).
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — composition wire map, tier semantics,
    per-slot responsibilities.
  - `POSITIONING.md` — vs ad-hoc OSS agent frameworks / hardened
    OSS frameworks / enterprise SaaS; the only column whose
    user-facing answer is "verify yourself" is v57.
  - `paper_draft.md` — position paper.
- **Local verification (M4, this build).** `make check-v57`
  → 49/49 PASS. `make verify-agent` (no external proof tooling
  installed) → 6 PASS, 3 SKIP, 0 FAIL — the SKIPs are honest
  reports for `verify-c` (Frama-C absent), `certify` (DO-178C
  pipeline tooling absent), `red-team` (Garak / DeepTeam absent).
  Never a silent PASS.
- **Cross-doc.** README, `docs/SIGMA_FULL_STACK.md`,
  `docs/DOC_INDEX.md`, `docs/WHAT_IS_REAL.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `creation.md` updated with v57 entries; version ranges bumped
  from `v31–v56` / `v33–v56` (and earlier `v33–v51`, `v33–v55`)
  to `v31–v57` / `v33–v57`.
- **What v57 deliberately does not claim.** Not FAA / EASA
  certification (v49 artifacts are tier I, not a certificate).
  Not zero CVEs (small surface, but smallness is not absence).
  Not frontier-model accuracy (model choice lives in the routing
  slot). Not a replacement for any specific commercial product
  (the `--positioning` table uses category names, with CVE / ARR
  figures cited from the driving oivallus prompt as user-supplied
  reporting).
- **Tier tags.** v57 convergence registry: **M** runtime-checked.
  v57 paper draft: **I**. v57 live aggregate (`make verify-agent`):
  **M** orchestration with honest **SKIP** reporting for missing
  tooling.

## v56 σ-Constitutional scaffold (2026-04-16)

- **Four Q1-2026 insights, one C11 invariant.** Rule-based process
  reward models (VPRM, arXiv:2601.17223), in-place test-time
  training (IP-TTT, arXiv:2604.06169, April 2026), grokking as
  phase transition under Singular Learning Theory (arXiv:2603.01192
  + 2603.13331, March 2026), and the 2026 reverse-engineered Apple
  Neural Engine `matmul → 1×1 conv` contract, composed into a
  single policy: **any inference-time self-modification must
  strictly lower σ**. Inference-side dual of v40's `K_eff = (1−σ)·K`.
- **Verifier module (`src/v56/verifier.{c,h}`)** — rule-based PRM.
  Seven deterministic rules (`NONEMPTY`, `MIN_LENGTH`, `MAX_LENGTH`,
  `SCORE_BOUNDED`, `SCORE_MONOTONE`, `NO_EXACT_REPEAT`,
  `CHAR_ENTROPY`); aggregate `sigma_verifier = 1 − precision`
  (the VPRM paper's priority metric, in canonical σ frame).
  Precision-first F1; branchless per-step evaluation.
- **σ-gated IP-TTT policy (`src/v56/ipttt.{c,h}`)** — slow / recent
  σ EWMA bands, decide-reason-tagged budget controller
  (`DENY_BUDGET`, `DENY_COOLDOWN`, `DENY_NO_DRIFT`, `DENY_INVALID`,
  `ALLOW`). Commit iff post-update σ does not regress, else
  rollback with `alpha_current *= rollback_shrink`. Fresh
  controllers begin in warm-up (no insta-update on boot).
- **Grokking commutator σ-channel (`src/v56/grokking.{c,h}`)** —
  normalized defect `‖g_new − g_prev‖² / (‖g_new‖² + ‖g_prev‖²)`
  bounded in `[0, 1]`, NEON 4-accumulator reduction with prefetch
  on both inputs, scalar tail fixup for arbitrary dims. Baseline
  EWMA + warm-up-armed spike detector; phase_transition_detected
  flips when `latest > baseline × spike_multiplier`. First public
  runtime exposure of the SLT trajectory signal as an inference-time
  σ-channel, orthogonal to v34 / v55 output-distribution σ.
- **ANE dispatch layout helper (`src/v56/ane_layout.{c,h}`)** —
  pure integer math for the undocumented
  `A[M,K] @ B[K,N] → conv(input=[1,K,1,N], weight=[M,K,1,1])`
  rewrite, with the ANE-enforced spatial ≥ 16 ∧ multiple-of-16
  validator, padding plan (`pad_h`, `pad_w`, `pad_bytes_fp32`),
  and a short, loggable `reason` string. **No** Core ML, **no**
  `_ANEClient`, **no** MLModel compilation — just the prerequisite
  shape contract any future binding will need.
- **Hardware path (M4-first).** NEON `vld1q_f32` / `vfmaq_f32`
  reductions on the defect kernel with `__builtin_prefetch` on
  `g_new` and `g_prev` both, 16-wide unrolled accumulator quartet,
  scalar tail fixup; scalar fallback bit-identical on non-ARM;
  branchless policy arithmetic everywhere else. No allocations on
  the hot path; compile-time `V56_GROK_HAS_NEON` switch gates the
  scalar-only function to avoid an unused-function warning.
- **56/56 deterministic self-test** (`make check-v56`): verifier
  precision / F1 / σ (5), IP-TTT cooldown / drift / budget /
  rollback / commit (6), grokking identical / opposite / orthogonal
  / NEON-tail-fixup-vs-scalar / spike detection (5), ANE round-up /
  small-matmul fail / aligned-width still fail on H=1 / NCHW shapes
  / reason string (5), full-loop integration test tying all four
  modules (6). No network, no engine, no tensors.
- **Docs:** `docs/v56/ARCHITECTURE.md` (wire map + per-module
  contracts + composition tree with v34 / v40 / v45 / v47 / v51 /
  v53 / v54 / v55), `docs/v56/POSITIONING.md` (vs VPRM / ThinkPRM /
  IP-TTT / TTSR / VDS-TTT / SLT grokking / ANE RE / SME2, with
  tier placement), `docs/v56/paper_draft.md` (σ-Constitutional
  position paper — policy certification, not benchmark).
- **Tier tags.** `verifier`, `ipttt`, `grokking`, `ane_layout`: M
  inside the scaffold boundary (they do what their tests say).
  End-to-end TTT on a real transformer: P (planned, needs
  bitnet.cpp / MLX hook). ANE dispatch via Core ML / private API:
  P (planned, needs Apple-only CoreML target). See
  `docs/WHAT_IS_REAL.md`.

## v55 σ₃-speculative scaffold (2026-04-16)

- **Three 2026 insights, one C11 policy layer.** σ₃ decomposition
  (Taparia et al., arXiv:2603.24967, March 2026), EARS adaptive
  acceptance (Sun et al., arXiv:2512.13194, December 2025), and EASD
  entropy-aware quality gate (Su et al., arXiv:2512.23765, December
  2025) composed into a branchless acceptance surface. EARS fixes
  random rejection (asymmetric uncertainty); EASD fixes random
  acceptance (symmetric uncertainty + top-K overlap); σ₃ supplies
  the signal that tells the two apart. See `docs/v55/POSITIONING.md`.
- **Honest network story.** `src/v55/` opens no sockets, loads no
  weights, speaks no API (creation.md invariant #3). The scaffold
  is the policy underneath a future bitnet.cpp / vLLM integration.
- **σ₃ module:** `src/v55/sigma3.{c,h}` — `v55_sigma3_t` (σ_input,
  σ_knowledge, σ_decoding, σ_total, raw h_bits, top_k_used).
  Deterministic proxies on caller-supplied softmax:
  - σ_input = normalized Gini dispersion over top-K probabilities,
  - σ_knowledge = 1 − max(P) (same signal EARS exploits),
  - σ_decoding = H / log₂(N), clamped [0, 1].
- **EARS acceptance:** `src/v55/ears.{c,h}` — `v55_ears_accept(...)`
  returns 0/1 via `r < min(max_threshold, P_t/P_d + α · σ_knowledge)`.
  α = 0 is bit-identical to vanilla spec-decode. Batch helper writes
  an int mask; no allocations, no branches on the data path.
- **EASD quality gate:** `src/v55/easd.{c,h}` — `v55_easd_decide(...)`
  sets `reject` iff all three hold: H_t ≥ τ, H_d ≥ τ, |topK_t ∩ topK_d|/K ≥ ρ.
  Composes *on top of* EARS; they solve opposite failure modes.
- **Hardware path (M4-first).** NEON 4-accumulator entropy loop
  (`vld1q_f32` loads, `vmlaq_f32` accumulators, `__builtin_prefetch`
  ahead of each 16-lane iteration) with a branchless fast log₂
  approximation (IEEE-754 exponent extraction + 2nd-order minimax
  polynomial, ±0.01 bits). Scalar fallback bit-identical on non-ARM
  for CI reproducibility. Scratch is caller-owned; no `malloc` on
  the hot path.
- **29/29 deterministic self-test** (`make check-v55`): σ₃ uniform
  vs one-hot vs two-peak; σ_total bound; from_logits peaked;
  EARS α = 0 matches vanilla; EARS relaxes under knowledge gap;
  EARS clamp; batch matches scalar; EASD confident pass-through;
  EASD both-uncertain-with-overlap reject; EASD both-uncertain-but-
  disagreeing pass-through (uncertainty is informative); EASD
  asymmetric pass-through (EARS regime).
- **Makefile / build:** `V55_SRCS` + `standalone-v55`, `test-v55`,
  `check-v55`; `-Isrc/v55` compile flag; added to `.PHONY`, `help`,
  and `.gitignore`. Not in `merge-gate`; strictly opt-in.
- **Docs:** `docs/v55/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/v55/POSITIONING.md`,
  `docs/v55/paper_draft.md`. Cross-doc updates: scope v31–v55 in
  README / SIGMA_FULL_STACK / CONTRIBUTING / v53 paper; tier row in
  WHAT_IS_REAL; index row in DOC_INDEX; last-landed in creation.md.
- **Tier tags:** scaffold (M) for `make check-v55`, interpretive
  (I) for the paper draft, product (P) for a live bitnet.cpp /
  vLLM integration reporting real throughput gains — deferred.

## v54 σ-proconductor scaffold (2026-04-16)

- **Structural claim, not a live ensemble.** σ is the missing
  routing signal in the 2024–2026 multi-LLM literature
  (MoA / RouteLLM / MoMA / FrugalGPT / Bayesian Orchestration /
  MoErging). v54 encodes σ as the routing + aggregation + abstention
  signal over frontier subagents. See `docs/v54/POSITIONING.md`.
- **Honest network story.** `src/v54/` makes **no network calls**
  (creation.md invariant #3). The scaffold is the orchestration
  policy; callers supply per-agent responses + σ. The self-test is
  fully deterministic, offline, and embeddings-free.
- **Registry + defaults:** `src/v54/proconductor.{c,h}` —
  `v54_subagent_t`, `v54_proconductor_t`, five hand-tuned reference
  profiles (`claude`, `gpt`, `gemini`, `deepseek`, `local_bitnet`).
- **Dispatch policy:** `src/v54/dispatch.{c,h}` — keyword-heuristic
  classifier; deterministic top-K selector (stakes-scaled K ∈ {1, 2, 4}
  with an easy-query shortcut when σ_primary < 0.10); σ-weighted
  aggregator with five outcomes:
  `V54_AGG_CONSENSUS`, `V54_AGG_SIGMA_WINNER`,
  `V54_AGG_ABSTAIN_SIGMA`, `V54_AGG_ABSTAIN_DISAGREE`,
  `V54_AGG_EMPTY`.
- **Disagreement analyzer:** `src/v54/disagreement.{c,h}` —
  lexical-Jaccard similarity over tokens with outlier detection.
  Pluggable; a production runtime swaps the kernel for an embedding
  backend without touching the rest of the pipeline.
- **Profile learner:** `src/v54/learn_profiles.{c,h}` — EWMA
  (α = 0.05) on per-domain σ + observed-accuracy;
  `v54_learn_from_aggregation()` attributes ground truth to the winner
  only (non-winners receive "unknown" so no false reward/punishment).
- **Paper draft:** `docs/v54/paper_draft.md` — "σ-Proconductor: σ as
  the Missing Routing Signal for Multi-LLM Ensembles" (I-tier
  position paper with explicit follow-up router benchmark scope).
- **Architecture + positioning:** `docs/v54/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `docs/v54/POSITIONING.md` (side-by-side vs MoA / RouteLLM / MoMA /
  FrugalGPT / Bayesian Orchestration / MoErging).
- **Makefile:** `make check-v54` (14/14 self-test); `make standalone-v54`;
  help + `.PHONY` updated. **Not** part of `merge-gate`.

## v53 σ-governed harness scaffold (2026-04-16)

- **Structural critique, not clone.** Takes Claude Code's public harness
  primitives (`nO` / `h2A` / TAOR / `wU2` / sub-agents / `claude.md` /
  Plan Mode / fork agents / 4-layer compression) as given, and encodes
  σ-governance over the top. See `docs/v53/POSITIONING.md`.
- **σ-TAOR loop:** `src/v53/harness/loop.{c,h}` —
  `while (tool_call && σ < threshold && σ_ewma < drift_cap && making_progress)`.
  Five distinct abstain outcomes (`ABSTAIN_SIGMA`, `ABSTAIN_DRIFT`,
  `ABSTAIN_NO_PROG`, `ABSTAIN_NO_TOOLS`, `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`) + `COMPLETE`
  + reserved `SAFETY_BLOCK`. Consumes v51 `cognitive_step` for per-iter σ.
- **σ-triggered sub-agent dispatch:** `src/v53/harness/dispatch.{c,h}` —
  specialist spawn policy keyed on per-domain σ (security / performance /
  correctness defaults). Specialist runs in fresh context; returns
  summary + own σ (Mama Claude: uncorrelated context = test-time compute).
- **σ-prioritized compression:** `src/v53/harness/compress.{c,h}` —
  qualitative scoring (σ-resolution +2.0, invariant-reference +1.5,
  tool-use +1.0, peak σ +σ, filler −0.5); `v53_compress_batch` percentile
  cutoff keeps learning moments + invariant refs ahead of routine filler.
- **`creation.md` loader:** `src/v53/harness/project_context.{c,h}` —
  conservative markdown parser. Counts invariants, conventions,
  σ-profile rows. Missing file → `ok = 0`.
- **Invariants file:** `creation.md` at repo root — **invariants**,
  not instructions; σ-profile per task type; explicit rule "invariant
  beats convention; two-invariant conflict ⇒ abstain + surface".
- **Paper draft:** `docs/v53/paper_draft.md` — "Harness Architecture:
  Why σ-Governance Beats Time-Limits in Agentic Coding" (I-tier
  position paper; explicit follow-up benchmark scope).
- **Architecture + positioning:** `docs/v53/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `docs/v53/POSITIONING.md`.
- **Makefile:** `make check-v53` (13/13 self-test); `make standalone-v53`;
  help + `.PHONY` updated. **Not** part of `merge-gate`.

## v51 AGI-complete integration scaffold (2026-04-16)

- **Scaffold:** `src/v51/cognitive_loop.{c,h}` — six-phase loop
  (Perceive → Plan → Execute → Verify → Reflect → Learn). Pure C, deterministic,
  allocation-free hot path. Planner-facing σ is normalized softmax entropy in [0,1];
  v34 Dirichlet evidence is rescaled + surfaced as aleatoric/epistemic channels.
- **Agent:** `src/v51/agent.{c,h}` — σ-gated bounded agent loop with sandbox
  policy table (fail-closed on unknown tool), σ-deny threshold, and a ring
  experience buffer (cap 64). No "try anyway" loop — abstains cleanly.
- **UX spec:** `config/v51_experience.yaml` (chat/expert/serve/benchmark/certify
  modes — aspirational `creation-os` wrapper CLI documented honestly).
- **Web UI:** `src/v51/ui/web.html` — single-file static σ-dashboard mock
  (per-token color, abstention styled as calm gray notice, 8-channel view,
  System 1/2/Deep-Think indicator). No build step, no third-party deps.
- **Installer:** `scripts/v51/install.sh` — **safe dry-run** (no network,
  no `/usr/local/bin` writes, no weight downloads). Explains what a future
  signed `curl | sh` installer would do.
- **Architecture:** `docs/v51/ARCHITECTURE.md` — one-picture view of the
  v33–v50 layer stack, explicit "is / is not" scope section.
- **Makefile:** `make check-v51` (13/13 self-test); `make standalone-v51`;
  help + `.PHONY` updated. **Not** part of `merge-gate`.

## v50 final benchmark rollup harness (2026-04-16)

- **Harness:** `make v50-benchmark` → `benchmarks/v50/run_all.sh` (explicit **STUB** JSON slots for standard eval names until an engine+dataset harness exists).
- **Report:** `benchmarks/v50/FINAL_RESULTS.md` (generated; tables + honest tiering).
- **Automation:** `benchmarks/v50/generate_final_report.py` aggregates stub JSON + `certify`/`mcdc`/`binary_audit` logs.
- **Docs:** `docs/v50/FAQ_CRITICS.md`, `docs/v50/REDDIT_ML_POST_DRAFT.md` (do-not-post-until-real-numbers banner).
- **Honest scope:** Category 1–3 are **not** M-tier measurements yet; Category 4 logs what ran in-repo (`make certify`, coverage, audit).

## v49 certification-grade assurance pack (2026-04-16)

- **Docs:** `docs/v49/certification/` — DO-178C-*language* plans (PSAC/SDP/SVP/SCMP/SQAP), HLR/LLR/SDD, traceability matrix + `trace_manifest.json`, structural coverage notes, DO-333-style formal methods report, assurance ladder.
- **Code:** `src/v49/sigma_gate.{c,h}` — fail-closed scalar abstention gate (traceability + MC/DC driver target).
- **Tests / coverage:** `tests/v49/mcdc_tests.c` + `scripts/v49/run_mcdc.sh` (gcov/lcov best-effort).
- **Audit:** `scripts/v49/binary_audit.sh` (symbols/strings/strict compile/ASan+UBSan/optional valgrind — lab hygiene, not “Cellebrite certification”).
- **Trace automation:** `scripts/v49/verify_traceability.py`.
- **Makefile:** `make certify` / `certify-*` (aggregates formal targets + coverage + audit + `red-team` + trace checks).
- **Honest scope:** **not** FAA/EASA DAL-A certification; this is an **in-repo assurance artifact pack** aligned to DO-178C *discipline*.

## v48 σ-armored red-team lab (2026-04-16)

- **Artifact:** `creation_os_v48` — `detect_anomaly` (per-token epistemic statistics + baseline distance), `sandbox_check` (σ-gated privilege stub), `run_all_defenses` (7-layer fail-closed aggregate).
- **Red team:** `make red-team` (Garak/DeepTeam **SKIP** unless installed + REST model), `tests/v48/red_team/sigma_bypass_attacks.py`, `property_attacks.py` (pytest).
- **Gate:** `make merge-gate-v48` — `verify` + `red-team` + `check-v31` + `reviewer` (optional heavy; SKIPs OK when tools absent).
- **Docs:** [docs/v48/RED_TEAM_REPORT.md](docs/v48/RED_TEAM_REPORT.md); README σ-lab table + stack map; `docs/WHAT_IS_REAL.md`, `docs/SIGMA_FULL_STACK.md`, `docs/DOC_INDEX.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Honest scope:** Garak/DeepTeam are **harness hooks**, not in-repo “90% defense” claims; σ-anomaly heuristics are **T-tier** lab code, not a certified robustness proof.

## v47 verified-architecture lab (2026-04-16)

- **Artifact:** `creation_os_v47` — ACSL-documented float σ-kernel (`src/v47/sigma_kernel_verified.c`, Frama-C/WP target), ZK-σ **API stub** (`src/v47/zk_sigma.c`, not succinct / not ZK), SymbiYosys **extended-depth** replay (`hdl/v47/sigma_pipeline_extended.sby`), Hypothesis property tests (`tests/v47/property_tests.py`), `make verify` / `trust-report`.
- **Verify:** `make check-v47`; broader stack: `make verify` (SKIPs when `frama-c` / `sby` / `pytest+hypothesis` absent).
- **Docs:** [docs/v47/INVARIANT_CHAIN.md](docs/v47/INVARIANT_CHAIN.md); README σ-lab table + stack map; `docs/WHAT_IS_REAL.md`, `docs/SIGMA_FULL_STACK.md`, `docs/DOC_INDEX.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Honest scope:** Layer-7 ZK is **P-tier** until a circuit-backed prover exists; Frama-C “M-tier” requires a pinned proof log, not merely annotations.

## v46 σ-optimized BitNet pipeline lab (2026-04-16)

- **Artifact:** `creation_os_v46` — `v46_fast_sigma_from_logits` (Dirichlet σ + softmax entropy + margin blend), SIMD sum/max (`sigma_simd`), `v46_sigma_adaptive_quant`, latency profile helper.
- **Verify:** `make check-v46`; e2e stub: `make bench-v46-e2e`.
- **Docs / tables:** [docs/v46_bitnet_sigma.md](docs/v46_bitnet_sigma.md), [benchmarks/v46/SPEED_TABLE.md](benchmarks/v46/SPEED_TABLE.md) (explicit **I/M/N** tags); README σ-lab table + stack row; `docs/SIGMA_FULL_STACK.md`, `docs/WHAT_IS_REAL.md`, `docs/DOC_INDEX.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Honest scope:** no wall-clock “<3% σ overhead” claim until `benchmarks/v46/*.json` exists; BitNet headline numbers remain **I-tier** imports unless reproduced in-repo.

## v45 σ-introspection lab (2026-04-16)

- **Artifact:** `creation_os_v45` — `v45_measure_introspection_lab` (σ-derived confidence vs synthetic self-report → `calibration_gap` + `meta_sigma`), `v45_doubt_reward`, `v45_probe_internals_lab` (deterministic internal σ stand-in).
- **Verify:** `make check-v45`; paradox stub: `make bench-v45-paradox`.
- **Docs:** [docs/v45_introspection.md](docs/v45_introspection.md); README σ-lab table + stack row; `docs/SIGMA_FULL_STACK.md`, `docs/WHAT_IS_REAL.md`, `docs/DOC_INDEX.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Honest scope:** no archived multi-model introspection scatter until harness + `benchmarks/v45/introspection_*.json` exist; no real hidden-state probes until engine hooks land.

## v44 σ-native inference proxy lab (2026-04-16)

- **Artifact:** `creation_os_proxy` — stub logits → per-token Dirichlet σ → `decode_sigma_syndrome()` actions → OpenAI-shaped `POST /v1/chat/completions` (+ extra `choices[].sigma` JSON) and demo `text/event-stream` chunks.
- **Verify:** `make check-v44` (alias: `make check-proxy`); overhead stub: `make bench-v44-overhead`.
- **Docs / config:** [docs/v44_inference_proxy.md](docs/v44_inference_proxy.md), [config/proxy.yaml](config/proxy.yaml); README σ-lab table + stack row; `docs/SIGMA_FULL_STACK.md`, `docs/WHAT_IS_REAL.md`, `docs/DOC_INDEX.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Honest scope:** no archived engine A/B overhead JSON until harness scripts exist; streaming “retraction” is a **demo contract** only.

## v43 σ-guided knowledge distillation lab (2026-04-16)

- **Artifact:** `creation_os_v43` — σ-weighted KL (`v43_sigma_weight`, forward / reverse KL), progressive teacher-epistemic stages (`v43_distill_stages`), multi-teacher σ ensemble logits, calibration + total loss helpers.
- **Verify:** `make check-v43`; benchmark stub: `make bench-v43-distill`.
- **Docs:** [docs/v43_sigma_distill.md](docs/v43_sigma_distill.md); `docs/SIGMA_FULL_STACK.md`, `docs/WHAT_IS_REAL.md`, `docs/DOC_INDEX.md`; README σ-lab table + LLM stack row; `CONTRIBUTING.md` optional labs row.
- **Honest scope:** no in-tree `--distill` / TruthfulQA harness until weights + driver + REPRO bundle exist (tier tags in WHAT_IS_REAL).

## RTL silicon mirror + formal CI stack (2026-04-16)

- **RTL:** `rtl/cos_*_iron_combo.sv`, `cos_agency_iron_formal.sv`, `cos_agency_iron_cover.sv`, `cos_boundary_sync.sv`, `cos_silicon_chip_tb.sv`.
- **Chisel / Rust / Yosys / SBY / EQY:** `hw/chisel/`, `hw/rust/spektre-iron-gate`, `hw/yosys/*.ys`, `hw/formal/*.sby`, `hw/formal/agency_self.eqy`, [hw/openroad/README.md](hw/openroad/README.md).
- **Makefile:** `merge-gate` unchanged; add `stack-ultimate`, `stack-nucleon`, `stack-singularity`, `oss-formal-extreme`, `rust-iron-lint`, Verilator `-Wall --timing`, Yosys `sat -prove-asserts`, Chisel targets.
- **CI:** `creation-os/.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `merge-gate` + `stack-ultimate` + `rust-iron-lint` on apt tools; **`oss-cad-formal`** job ([`YosysHQ/setup-oss-cad-suite@v4`](https://github.com/YosysHQ/setup-oss-cad-suite)) runs **`make oss-formal-extreme`**; **`c11-asan-ubsan`**; **CodeQL**, **OpenSSF Scorecard**, **ShellCheck** workflows; Dependabot weekly on Actions.
- **Publish:** `tools/publish_to_creation_os_github.sh` preflight is **`make merge-gate && make stack-ultimate && make rust-iron-lint`**.
- **Docs:** [docs/RTL_SILICON_MIRROR.md](docs/RTL_SILICON_MIRROR.md), [docs/FULL_STACK_FORMAL_TO_SILICON.md](docs/FULL_STACK_FORMAL_TO_SILICON.md); `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, [hw/formal/README.md](hw/formal/README.md).

## The Tensor mind v12 (2026-04-15)

- **Artifact:** [`creation_os_v12.c`](creation_os_v12.c) — v11 **plus** M35–M37 (MPS contraction toy, entanglement σ-meter on singular-value toy, TN sequence head); **52** `self_test` checks.

- **Build / publish:** `Makefile` `standalone-v12`, `test-v12`, `check-v12`; `.gitignore` + `publish_to_creation_os_github.sh` strip `creation_os_v12`; preflight runs all `check-v*` after `make check`.

## Visuals — pro diagram pass (2026-04-15)

- **SVG refresh:** [architecture-stack.svg](docs/assets/architecture-stack.svg), [bsc-primitives.svg](docs/assets/bsc-primitives.svg), [gemm-vs-bsc-memory-ops.svg](docs/assets/gemm-vs-bsc-memory-ops.svg), [evidence-ladder.svg](docs/assets/evidence-ladder.svg), [planes-abc.svg](docs/assets/planes-abc.svg) — consistent typography, shadows, accent rules, updated v2 line count, legend + callouts on benchmark figure.

- **Docs:** [VISUAL_INDEX.md](docs/VISUAL_INDEX.md) — theme column, design-system section, citation note for lineage figure; README doctoral path embeds lineage SVG; DOC_INDEX pointer.

## Docs — doctoral framing (2026-04-15)

- **README:** [doctoral and committee read path](README.md#doctoral-and-committee-read-path) — ordered list (CLAIM_DISCIPLINE → RESEARCH → REPRO bundle → FEATURES map → MODULE_EVIDENCE_INDEX → v6–v11 scoped docs → adversarial checklist) + v2 vs v6–v11 evidence-class table.
- **Iteration:** [LIVING_KERNEL_V6.md](docs/LIVING_KERNEL_V6.md), [HALLUCINATION_KILLER_V7.md](docs/HALLUCINATION_KILLER_V7.md), [PARAMETERS_IN_SILICON_V9.md](docs/PARAMETERS_IN_SILICON_V9.md) — **Threats to validity** + **How to cite** (parity with v10/v11); [ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md](docs/ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md) §A rows for forbidden merges **#5** / **#6** and v7 naming; footer links README doctoral path.

- **CLAIM_DISCIPLINE:** forbidden merges **#5** (v11 × BitNet-class claims), **#6** (v6–v11 `self_test` × frontier / tape-out / harness).
- **THE_REAL_MIND_V10** / **THE_MATMUL_FREE_MIND_V11:** threats-to-validity + **how to cite** blurbs; **DOC_INDEX** / **AGENTS** pointers updated.

## Ops — canonical Git (2026-04-15)

- **Docs:** [docs/CANONICAL_GIT_REPOSITORY.md](docs/CANONICAL_GIT_REPOSITORY.md) — only **https://github.com/spektre-labs/creation-os** is the product remote; parent protocol / umbrella checkouts must not receive `creation-os` as `origin`.
- **AGENTS / README / DOC_INDEX / publish script** point agents and humans to that rule.

## MatMul-free mind v11 (2026-04-15)

- **Artifact:** [`creation_os_v11.c`](creation_os_v11.c) — v10 **plus** M34 matmul-free LM schematic (ternary `BitLinearLayer` + element-wise `MLGRUState` forward); **49** `self_test` checks.

## Parameters in Silicon v9 (2026-04-15)

- **Artifact:** [`creation_os_v9.c`](creation_os_v9.c) — v7 Hallucination Killer **plus** M24–M29 schematic channels (neuromorphic event toy, CIM σ_transfer, memory wall, BNN toy, silicon-stack toy, heterogeneous orchestrator); **41** `self_test` checks.
- **Verify:** `make check-v9`; CI runs `make check && make check-v6 && make check-v7 && make check-v9 && make check-v10 && make check-v11`.
- **Docs:** [docs/PARAMETERS_IN_SILICON_V9.md](docs/PARAMETERS_IN_SILICON_V9.md); README + DOC_INDEX + GLOSSARY; v7 doc links v9 as sibling; [THE_REAL_MIND_V10.md](docs/THE_REAL_MIND_V10.md) is the v10 extension.
- **Build / publish:** `Makefile` targets `standalone-v9`, `test-v9`, `check-v9`; `.gitignore` + publish script strip `creation_os_v9`; `publish_to_creation_os_github.sh` preflight runs v6/v7/v9/v10/v11 checks after `make check`.

- **Build / publish:** `Makefile` targets `standalone-v7`, `test-v7`, `check-v7`; `.gitignore` + publish script strip `creation_os_v7` binary.

## Living Kernel v6 (2026-04-15)

- **Artifact:** [`creation_os_v6.c`](creation_os_v6.c) — second standalone C11 program: σ–`K`–`L`–`S` scaffold, M01–M18 narrative modules (RDP, alignment tax, preference collapse, RAIN-style σ-tape, ghost boot, Gödel-boundary toy, …), 1024-bit packed BSC in this file (distinct from 4096-bit `creation_os_v2.c` + `COS_D`).
- **Verification:** `make check-v6` builds `creation_os_v6` and runs `./creation_os_v6 --self-test` (**30** deterministic checks).
- **Docs:** [docs/LIVING_KERNEL_V6.md](docs/LIVING_KERNEL_V6.md) — scope, evidence class, non-claims, module map; README hub row + *Living Kernel (v6)* section + limitations bullet; [docs/COMMON_MISREADINGS.md](docs/COMMON_MISREADINGS.md) row for v6 vs harness / paper confusion.
- **Build / publish:** `Makefile` targets `standalone-v6`, `test-v6`, `check-v6`; `.gitignore` + publish script strips `creation_os_v6` binary before rsync.

## v2.0 (2026-04-15)
